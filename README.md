## DomainDissidence
#### Generate a website to encourage mass boycotts of malicious brands — without any programming knowledge! 
*My UT Dallas Capstone project for Fall 2025. ☄️*


### ABOUT
- A simple method of generating a spoof website that offers fake discount codes for problematic companies.
- When the “coupons” are attempted to be redeemed, the website redirects to a list of all the exploitative behavior of the problematic companies instead.
- It’s designed to directly target and inform the patrons of said companies and to deter them from giving money towards detrimental activities.



### PROJECT GOALS
1. Offer a unique way for individuals to combat widespread injustice perpetuated by corporations/organizations.

2. Solve the problem of citizens feeling voiceless when facing systemic/societal injustice.

3. Contribute to the new(ish) concept of internet-sourced activism.**
